# Programming Language Survey

#### By Richard Barbour II

#### Take a brief questionnaire to determine which programming language you should learn first.


## Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS
* JS


## Description

This webpage contains a short five-question survey to help the user determine which programming language they should learn first: C#, C++ or Python. The user is also prompted to enter a name. After the user submits the form, the program greets the user by name and presents the best programming language for the user to learn based on an "algorithm" consisting of simple branching logic using the user's responses. The user, or multiple users, can resubmit the form multiple times as well as clear the form and/or results using a reset button. However, the form requires all fields to be completed before submission and the submission button becomes disabled after submission until the form and/or results have been reset.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

1. Navigate to https://github.com/rbarcode/w2-programming-language-suggester in an internet browser.
2. Click on the green “<> Code” button approximately 2/3s to the right-hand side of the page near the top.
3. On the “Local” tab of the mini-window that opens underneath the “<>Code” button, copy the HTTPS link in the gray bar to your clipboard.
4. In GitBash (or your terminal/shell of your choice/computer), navigate to the directory where you wish to download the project and enter the following prompt (replacing the italicized word with the appropriate link): git clone *url-of-the-repository-copied-in-the-previous-step*
5. Your chosen directory will now contain a folder titled “w2-programming-language-suggester”.
6. You can open the folder “w2-programming-language-suggester” in VS Code (for example, by using the appropriate commands in GitBash or using the GUI and right-clicking on the option to “Open with Code” in the menu that pops up… note, you may need to select “Show more options” at the bottom of the menu if you don’t see “Open with Code” in the provided list).
7. You can now read and edit the project files!

## Known Bugs

There are no known bugs. To resubmit the form, don't forget to hit the "reset" button!
