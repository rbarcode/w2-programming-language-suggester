      <div id="c#" class="hidden">
        <p>Hi, <span id="c#-user-name"></span>! You should study the <strong>C# programming language</strong>. C# was developed at Microsoft in the early 2000s and is a general-purpose high-level object-oriented programming language. C# was the eighth most popular programming language among professional developers in <a href="https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/">Stack Overflow's 2023 survey</a>. The Unity game engine uses C#, and it is also the back-end language taught at Epicodus (along with HTML/CSS and JavaScript for front-end development)!</p>
