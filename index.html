      <p>Your result: </p>
      <p id="c#" class="hidden">You should study the <strong>C# programming language</strong>. C# was developed at Microsoft in the early 2000s and is a general-purpose high-level object-oriented programming language. C# was the eighth most popular programming language among professional developers in Stack Overflow's 2023 survey. The Unity game engine uses C#, and it is also the back-end language taught at Epicodus (along with HTML/CSS and JavaScript for front-end development)!</p>
      <p id="c++" class="hidden">You should study the <strong>C++ programming language</strong>. C++ was developed at Bell Labs in the late 1970s as an extension to the C programming language, and released in the mid 1980s. C++ was the ninth most popular programming language among professional developers in Stack Overflow's 2023 survey. It is used in operating systems including MacOS, iOS and Windows, in databases like MySQL and MongoDB, and in videogame engines like the Unreal Engine.</p>
